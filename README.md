A Multi-Activity Android App

I decided to use the Company to Work For topic for this project.
Details:
The user would select a company to work for (out of 5 choices),
with additional topics including the companyâ€™s overview (number of employees, revenue,
headquarters, and the company culture, etc.), while the other, with more detailed
information, could include some detailed data about the expected pay scale,  
bonus likelihood, work environment, benefits, promotion prospects, etc.
